		<b>The Immortals Of Meluha : </b>is one of my favourite book. Amish, in this book explain the story in such a beautiful
        way as it seems to happen in front of our eyes. It takes you back around 4000 years and a story of a common man whose good deeds
        transform him into the great Mahadev. It has mind blowing dialogues .It is definitely worth a read for those who are searching for a book to read
        . <br><br>

		<b>IKIGAI :The Japanese Secret To A Long And Happy Life </b>One of the best self help books i have read. It not only imparts theoritical knowledge but also provides practical examples. One of the best lines i came across in the book is - ''The happiest people are not the ones
         who achieve the most'. They are the ones who spend more time than others in a state of flow.'' The books helps us gather methods in order to build an active life mentally and physically in addition to finding your ikigai...<br><br>

		<b>A Thousand Splendid Suns</b> The story is so gripping that you wouldn't be able to put down the book till you've finished it. Khalid is an excellent story teller and this masterpiece just proves it. The story revolves around two women with completely different family backgrounds and upbringing but brought together by fate to defeat a common evil. In this story, the evil is their husband. The story takes us
         on the journey of the hardships faced by these two women and it feels so real that you just want their misery to end with all your heart. <br><br>

		<b>Satyarthprakash </b>In my opinion Satyarth Prakash is a  Unparallel book in the world. The author mahrishi dayanand in this book made efforts to reform/ transform each and every person  of the world irrespective of country and religion. He wanted to eradicate all blind faith, superstions and unscientific temper from the world. Every intellectual person must read it. I studied it sevral time. It inspired me like anything to make efforts for eradication of superstion and uscientific temper from the society and I am doing so.<br><br>

		<b>Data Structure by </b> It is the first book I have read on Data Structure and i found no difficulty in understanding even the complex 
        topic from this book but the only problem with this book is that it contains only the pseudo code you have to implement
        with any programming language by your side .<br><br>
